    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This fish batter recipe makes the lightest, crispiest batter imaginable! <br>
       I received this recipe on a talk radio show in the early 1950s. <br>
       It makes enough to coat approximately 2 pounds of fish.</p> 
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>½ cup milk</li>
        <li>½ cup water</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Cooking process</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather ingredients.</li>
        <li>Whisk flour, milk, water, baking powder, <br>
            and salt together in a bowl until smooth.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Oven time</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in a deep fryer to 365 degrees F (185 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Dip fish fillets into the batter to coat.</li>
        <li>Carefully lower fillets, one at a time, into the hot oil. <br>
            Fry several fillets at a time, turning once, until cooked through and golden brown, <br>
            about 2 minutes per side.</li>
        <li>Drain on paper towels.</li>
    </ol>
